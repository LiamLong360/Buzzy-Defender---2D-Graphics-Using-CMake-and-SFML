Description:
ECE_Buzzy class. Represents the player-controlled character ("Buzzy") as a
sprite. Inherits from Sprite to gain position, drawing, and transformation
methods. Includes functions for scaling to the window size, setting and
retrieving movement speed, and updating position based on keyboard input.

     *      Uses 'explicit' to prevent unintended implicit conversions when
     *      passing a Texture to the constructor.
